#   list of tests in the repository, and suggestions when to run them (can be overridden in test.conf.yaml or feature.test.conf.yaml).

# List of:
# <test type> :
#   - name : <test suite>
#       F.ex.: TestAgencySearch
#     path :
#       Optional. Path to file, if different from default path, and named different than <test suite>.<test type file extension>
#       Default path: test/<test type>/<test suite>.<test type file extension>
#     title :
#       Optional. Title of the test suite, suitable for reports
#     description :
#       Optional. A short description of the test suite, suitable for reports
#     group :

#     workflow :
#       At what state in the workflow should the test be run.
#       One or more of: feature, develop, staging, production, all. Default: [all]
#     environment :
#       Which database to test against.
#       One or more of: empty, static, daily, production, all. Default: [all]
#       - where static is a monthly snapshot of the database, and daily a daily snapshot.
#       Tests that should never be run against a production database - either because they will mess up the database,
#       or are certain fo fail, should explicit configure which database to test against. F.ex. [empty, static, daily]
#     coverage :
#       Test depth

selenium :

# - name : <test suite>
#   path :
#     Path to file, if different from default path, and named different than <test suite>.test
#     Default path: test/simpletest/<test suite>.test

#           Bibliotek.dk's Jenkins jobs will ignore tests in a '*/simpletest/*' directory.
#   workflow :
#     NB: 'all' test use standard Drupal test API: drush test-run --all (at least to begin with)
